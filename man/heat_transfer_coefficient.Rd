\description{
Calculate heat transfer coefficient (based on Mitchell 1976)
(Uses Table 1 which is Convective Heat Trasfer Relations to Animal Shapes)
}
\details{
This function allows you estimate the heat transfer coefficient for various taxa (based on Mitchell 1976).  Approximates forced convective heat transfer for animal shapes using the convective relationship for a sphere.
