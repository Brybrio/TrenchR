\item{D}{Characteristic dimension of the animal in meters}

\item{K_g}{Thermal conductivity of substrate (W K^-1 m^-1 )}

\item{A}{Surface area  in m^2}

\item{proportion}{In contact to the surface}
}
\value{
conductance (W)

\description{
Calculate conductance assuming substrate thermal conductivity is rate limiting
}
\details{
This function allows you to calculate conductance (W) of an ectothermic animal to its substate.
         Method assumes the major resistance to conduction is the substrate and that the interior of the 
         animal is equal in temperature to its surface (thermally well mixed).
