# TrenchR
Code contributions for TrenchR initiative

We aim to create an R package (TrenchR) encompassing resources for assessing the impact of the environment of organisms.  The package will build off and integrate with existing packages (e.g., NicheMapR).  Code (scripts and functions) will be accepting in any programming language and thorough commenting will be appreciated.  We would also appreciate your including a header that describes the intent, input, and output of your scripts and functions. 

Non-inclusive categories we hope to include:
Diurnal variation
Radiation and cloudiness  
Microclimate models 
Biophysical and energy balance models
